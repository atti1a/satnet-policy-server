//add_time specifies the ms, the start time, the end time, then the gs id


test_0 
Non-overlapping single MS single PS for simplest test

test_1
Non-overlapping times, request to a different policy server

MS_1 -- PS_1
    add_time(ms, 200, 300, 1)
    add_time(ms, 400, 500, 2)
    add_time(ms, 600, 700, 1)

MS_2 -- PS_2
    add_time(ms, 200, 300, 2)
    add_time(ms, 400, 500, 1)
    add_time(ms, 600, 700, 2)

test_2
Overlapping times, request to a different policy server

MS_1 -- PS_1
    add_time(ms, 200, 300, 1)
    add_time(ms, 400, 500, 2)
    add_time(ms, 600, 700, 1)

MS_2 -- PS_2
    add_time(ms, 200, 300, 1)

test_3
Request a time with a higher priority to invoke a cancel from a policy server
MS_1 -- PS_1
    add_time(ms, 200, 300, 1)
    add_time(ms, 400, 500, 2)
    add_time(ms, 600, 700, 1)

MS_2 -- PS_2
    add_time(ms, 200, 300, 1)


test_4
Request a time already designated with a lower priority to invoke a deny from a policy server

test_5
Request the same time from the same mission server to verify that time can't be assigned twice

test_6
Clear requested time for a MS that disconnects --> this is not handled by our policy server currently

test_7
Have impersonated MS connect to policy server --> verify that MS connection is closed by the policy server

test_8
Assign times back to back to a ms to specify a ms using two different gs back to back
MS_1 -- PS_1
    add_time(ms, 200, 300, 1)
    add_time(ms, 300, 500, 2)

test_9
Stateful connection, allow for a MS to disconnect, and timeout certain requests unless they reconnct within specified time --> not handled by policy server right now
